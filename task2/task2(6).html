    <h1>Welcome to coding intro</h1>
    <h2>About programming</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we
      order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our
      lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software
      companies â€” instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi,
      influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal
      trainer.

    <h3>About Html</h3>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to
      create web pages. It defines the structure and content of web pages using
      a series of elements and tags. HTML is the backbone of web development and
      is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and
      JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites

    <h4>About css</h4>
    <p>
      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, offers a flexible way to style web
      content, with styles originating from browser defaults, user preferences,
      or web designers. These styles can be applied inline, within an HTML
      document, or through external .css files for broader consistency
